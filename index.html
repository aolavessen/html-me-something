            <h3>Why did I choose to go into programming?</h3>
        <p>I've decided to get into programming to provide for my family. The day to day 
            existence has gotten old and I've always been attracted to computers. I started
            dabbling in CodeAcademy then moved on to a boot camp. I enjoyed every minute
            of this journey.
